# Optimistic View

Optimistic View is a data statistics website focused on the Ethereum Layer 2 network, Optimistic. This project aims to provide a clear and intuitive interface for users to easily view and understand various data and statistics of the Optimistic network.

## Project Background

With the development of blockchain technology, the transaction volume and complexity of the Ethereum network are increasing, leading to network congestion and rising transaction fees. Optimistic is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, which improves transaction speed and reduces costs by creating a new network layer on top of the Ethereum main chain. However, the data and statistics of the Optimistic network are scattered, making it difficult for users to access and understand this information. The Optimistic View project was born to solve this problem.

## Problem Solved

Optimistic View provides a centralized, easy-to-understand interface for users to easily view and understand various data and statistics of the Optimistic network, including but not limited to transaction volume, transaction fees, network activity, etc. This not only helps users better understand the operation of the Optimistic network, but also helps developers and researchers conduct data analysis and research.
